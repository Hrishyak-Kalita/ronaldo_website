  <h2>An athelete that can never be forgetten :</h2>
  <p>
    The Real Madrid and Portugal star is defined as much by his determination as he is by his astonishing achievements

It’s the legacy that a champion leaves behind for people to remember and not just the trophies and medals that one garnishes their cabinet with. 

In this regard, Cristiano Ronaldo has set a precedent that only a few athletes around the world are able to match, let alone beat. The 33-year-old superstar, in his ninth season at Real Madrid, has continued to shine like the stars. 

Records continue to tumble as blazed by the Funchal-born footballer, who is already at the summit of Real Madrid’s all-time scoring list, the gap constantly growing, and he continues to score gravity defying goals that make audiences gasp in awe. 

But do great goals make him a champion? Does smashing records and winning trophies make Ronaldo a champion? The work of a champion comes before the feat itself.
