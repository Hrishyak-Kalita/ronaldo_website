    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation:
      [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional
      footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Manchester
      United and captains the Portugal national team. Often considered the best
      player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of
      all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four
      European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32
      trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions
      Leagues, and the UEFA European Championship. Ronaldo holds the records for
      most appearances (183), goals (140), and assists (42) in the Champions
      League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals
      (117), and international appearances by a European (189). He is one of the
      few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and
      has scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country.

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
      Born Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro on February 5, 1985, in Funchal,
      Madeira, Portugal, a small island off the western coast of the country,
      Ronaldo is the youngest of four children born to Maria Dolores dos Santos
      and Jose Dinis Aveiro. He was named after Ronald Reagan, one of his
      father's favorite actors. Ronaldo grew up in a largely working class
      neighborhood in a small tin-roofed home that overlooked the ocean. His
      early life was shaped by hardship; his father, a gardener, often drank too
      much, and eventually died from kidney problems in 2005. To help keep the
      children fed, and maintain some financial stability, Ronaldo's mother
      worked as a cook and cleaning person.
    </p>

    <h2>Intro to Soccer</h2>
    <p>
      It was through his dad's work as an equipment manager at a boy's club that
      Ronaldo was first introduced to the game of soccer. By the time he was 10
      years old, he was already recognized as a phenomenon—a kid who ate, slept
      and drank the game. "All he wanted to do as a boy was play football," his
      godfather, Fernao Sousa, recalled for British reporters, adding, "He loved
      the game so much he'd miss meals or escape out of his bedroom window with
      a ball when he was supposed to be doing his homework." By his early teens,
      Ronaldo's talent and legend had grown considerably. After a stint with
      Nacional da liha da Madeira, he signed with Sporting Portugal in 2001.
      That same year, at the tender age of 16, Ronaldo turned heads with a
      mesmerizing performance against Manchester United, wowing even his
      opponents with his footwork and deft skill. He made such an impression
      that a number of United players asked their manager to try and sign the
      young player. It wasn't long before the club paid Ronaldo's team more than
      £12 million for his services - a record fee for a player of his age.
    </p>
    <h2>Success with Manchester United</h2>
    <p>
      Ronaldo did not disappoint the soccer world. He showed his promise early
      on in the 2004 FA Cup final, scoring the team's first three goals and
      helping them capture the championship. In 2008, a year after signing a
      five-year, £31 million contract, Ronaldo again justified his high salary
      when he put together one of the club's finest seasons in history, setting
      a franchise record for goals scored (42), and earning himself the FIFA
      World of the Year honor. In all, Ronaldo helped steer Manchester United to
      three premier league titles. But Ronaldo's time in England was marred by
      his mother's 2007 struggle with breast cancer as well as his father's
      death from alcohol-related illness. The latter was especially hard for
      Ronaldo as the two had been close, and the young athlete had often pushed
      for his father to enter rehab and address his drinking. His father,
      however, never accepted the offer.
    </p>
<h2>Read Madrid & National victory</h2>
    <p>
      As lauded as Ronaldo was on the field for Manchester United, his
      commitment to the club came under constant question. Speculation swirled
      that he wanted to play elsewhere. So in 2009, when Spanish soccer club
      Real Madrid agreed to pay United a record $131 million for the chance to
      sign him, nobody was all that surprised to see Ronaldo leave United. "I
      know that they are going to demand a lot of me to be successful at the
      club and I know that I'm going to have much more pressure than at
      Manchester United because I was there for many years," Ronaldo told
      reporters. "But it means a new challenge and is going to help me be the
      best footballer." In addition to his FIFA World Player of the year award,
      Ronaldo has also won the coveted Ballon d'OR, the Golden Boot, and been
      named the UEFA Club Forward of the Year, among other honors during the
      course of his career. On July 10, 2016, Ronaldo added another emotional
      victory to his accolades, leading Portugal to the European Championship
      final against France as his national team's captain. Although he was
      sidelined after suffering a knee injury 25 minutes into the match,
      Portugal went on to win the championship title 1-0, their first
      international trophy. Ronaldo's teammates said that he motivated them as
      team captain from the sidelines. "He gave us a lot of confidence and he
      said, 'Listen people, I'm sure we will win this Euro so stay together and
      fight for it,’” full-back Cedric Soares said after Portugal’s victory.
      "This is one of the happiest moments in my career,” Ronaldo commented.
      ”I’ve always said I wanted to win a trophy with the national team and make
      history. And I did it. Thank God, things went well for us." In January
      2017, Ronaldo won FIFA's 2016 best player of the year for the fourth time,
      beating out Lionel Messi. Ronaldo’s 2016 wins included the European
      Championship, Champions League, and Club World Cup, plus individual awards
      from UEFA and France Football magazine, according to USA Today. In his
      acceptance speech, Ronaldo said: "2016 was the best year of my career."
